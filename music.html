    <li><h1>Great confidence booster</h1></li>
<strong>Listening to music is also great for your <u><b>confidence</b></u>  There are no better ways to boost your self-esteem and confidence than listening to music. Music is a universal language enjoyed by everyone from every culture, and it has been proven to be a great source of <u><b>entertainment</b></u>. Listening to music makes us feel good inside, and boosts our self-esteem because we can enjoy the emotion that comes from playing an instrument or listening to a song. It improves our moods and emotions, giving us a positive outlook on life.</p>

<li> <h1>Learning another language can be easy when you like music </h1></li>
Why is it easier for some people to learn other languages while others struggle? According to Psychology Today , it has to do with the fact that language learners who also enjoy music can actually pick up languages faster than others. Why? It has something to do with the way our brain processes information. People who are good at music are usually better at learning other languages . 

<li><h1> Listening can be great for focus and getting things done</h1></li>
It’s also been proven that listening to music can help individuals <u><b>focus better</b></u>. According to a book called Music and Work: The Science and Psychology of Working in Groups , by Dominic Heale, music is a source of stimulation for the brain which can be a great thing if you need to study or get your work done. It helps promote attention and focus so you’re able to concentrate on what you’re doing more effectively.
<li><h1> You can relax and forget about all your troubles</h1></li>
As mentioned in the previous benefit, music has been proven to help you <b><u>relax</u></b>. When you’re having a stressful day, one of the best things you can do is to just sit back with friends or family and listen to some music. It will make you feel good inside by releasing all the tension you might have in your body, allowing it to relax. You’ll feel like a whole new person!  This is another reason why listening to music is a great hobby. It lets you de-stress and forget about your personal problems.

<li><h1>Listening to music can help you sleep better at night</h1></li>
According to Psychology Today, listening to music is a good way to fall asleep and stay asleep. There’s a reason why we take earphones and headphones when we go to sleep: it helps us relax by blocking out the sounds that keep us awake at night, allowing us to sleep better. Listening to music has been proven to be a great way to fall asleep and stay asleep.

<li><h1>Listening improves your memory and aids in learning new words</h1></li>
Listening to music is also also helpful for improving one’s memory and enhancing learning skills. According to Music and the Brain: The Science of a Human Obsession, by Simon Baron-Cohen, listening to music can help increase memory span. It can enhance language skills, such as word recognition and vocabulary, while helping improve motor functions like movement coordination and manipulation</strong>.

One interesting thing to note is that there is a huge difference between listening to music and singing. According to Psychology Today, “Listening to music without singing hasn’t been shown to enhance memory or actually improve memory, but it can still aid in both of these things.”  Singing has a greater effect on improving vocabulary, but the same isn’t true for listening to music.
