<strong> favorite hobby is travelling</strong>
<p> I like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot. But I have never travel by the ship yet.
I love to travel without a group and without a guide, despite the fact that I often find ourselves in a difficult situation in unfamiliar places. Usually, I travel with my husband or with my friends. Most of all I like to travel by car and spend a little time at different places. Although long journeys are tiring me sometimes, but that doesn't stop me. First of all, it’s always nice to stay in a different place for a change. Secondly, I’m interested in seeing new sights, exploring different cultures and else. Third, I love to spend time in beautiful places and admire the beauty of the natural attractions such as mountains, waterfalls, forest lakes, seas and oceans, forests, valleys, hills, etc. I have been in the mountains with my friends many times. Also I visited some European countries.  I was in London, Prague, Vienna, Belgrade, Istanbul and in other cities.</p>
